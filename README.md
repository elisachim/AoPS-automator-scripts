# AoPS-automator-scripts
These are a few scripts used while editing text on AoPS. They work on every macOS platform and they can be utilised in every text editor (local or in a web browser). 

To 'install' the scripts you can copy the scripts to the following location on your filesystem: /Users/<username>/Library/Services (<username> needs to be replaced with your own username).
